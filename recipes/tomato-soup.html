    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium red peppers</li>
        <li>2 cans of canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>4-5 sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 mozzarella ball</li>
        <li>1 tsp of sweet and hot paprika</li>
        <li>a bit of salt and optionally sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash the peppers, put them whole on a baking tray lined with baking paper and bake at a temperature of
            approx. 200Â° C for approx. 25 minutes. Once the
            peppers are roasted, peel the skin off. If the skin comes off with difficulty - you should put the still hot
            pepper into a foil bag, tie it and
            leave it for about 5-10 minutes, after this time there should be no problem with peeling.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            While the peppers are baking, chop the dried tomatoes, put them in a pot together with the chopped onion and
            garlic, glaze, add the tomatoes and cook,
            season to taste.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the roasted pepper, optionally set aside some and cut into cubes, leave for decoration.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Blend the soup into a cream, bring to a boil. Serve in bowls and top with piece of mozzarella cheese,
            croutons, sliced peppers and basil leaf for garnish.
